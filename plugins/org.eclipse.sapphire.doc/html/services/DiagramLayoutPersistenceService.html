<h1>DiagramLayoutPersistenceService</h1>

<p>DiagramLayoutPersistenceService is responsible for persisting layout of the diagram, such a location and
size of nodes, connection bend points, etc.</p>

<p>Unlike other services, DiagramLayoutPersistenceService is not defined by methods that must be
implemented, but rather by its expected behavior.</p>

<ol>
  <li>During service initialization, the implementation is expected to load layout information and transfer it to
    diagram parts using API such as DiagramNodePart.setNodeBounds().</li>
  <li>After initialization, the implementation is expected to listen for changes to diagram parts and persist
    layout information. Persistence can happen immediately or be deferred until the save event is received.</li>
  <li>If implementation defers layout persistence until save, it is expected to implement dirty() method and to
   issue DirtyStateEvent when this state changes.</li>
 </ol>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b>Example</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The architecture sample provides a comprehensive example of a custom 
implementation that persists layout in the same file as data.</p>
