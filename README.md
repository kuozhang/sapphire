### Introduction


[Sapphire](http://www.eclipse.org/sapphire/) is a user interface development framework that improves productivity.
Instead of focusing on individual widgets, layouts and data binding, the developers
focus on modeling the semantics of the data and declaring the general intent of
how the data it to be presented.

### Installing

Sapphire is distributed as a p2 repository, from which the various components can be installed. Every [release page](http://www.eclipse.org/sapphire/releases/)
either lists the URL of the repository (for finished releases) or includes a link to a Hudson build job (for in-progress releases).

### Building

The build is easy to run on a local machine.

 1. Make sure that you have JDK 6 and Ant installed. Both should be on the path.
 2. Set `JDK_16_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK 6 install.
 3. Clone the Sapphire Git repository and pick the desired branch.
 4. Open a shell to the Git workspace and execute `ant clean-start`.

The build must be able to pull dependencies from the eclipse.org downloads server and its mirrors. If you are behind a proxy, 
you will need to invoke build with proxy configuration. If the proxy is properly configured at the operating system
level, you should only need to add `-autoproxy` switch to the build command.

Example: `ant clean-start -autoproxy`

If you are working with multiple Sapphire branches, you may want to share the downloads directory so that every 
branch does not need to re-download everything it needs. The default downloads folder is 
`[root]/downloads`, but you can change it by setting the `SAPPHIRE_DOWNLOADS` environment variable or the `downloads`
property when invoking the build. An absolute path is required in both cases.

Example: `ant clean-start -Ddownloads=d:/sapphire/downloads`

Once the build completes, you will notice the following key folders in the Git workspace:

 * **build/repository** : Repository of build artifacts, including runtime bundles, source bundles and the SDK.
 * **dev-eclipse** : Eclipse with select plugins along with Sapphire SDK from the build. This Eclipse configuration is designed to be appropriate for working on Sapphire.
 * **dev-target** : Eclipse with select plugins along with all of Sapphire, including source bundles. This Eclipse configuration is designed to make a good target platform.
